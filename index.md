## Career Objectives

I want to get exposure to different deal processes through my investment banking role at Deutsche Bank. Afterwards, I aim to pivot to an investing role where I can leverage my knowledge in company analysis to identify undervalued opportunities in the Industrials and Commodities spaces. Investing required discipline in terms of understanding what a business is truly worth and not what it's being marketed as. I'm excited to build this investor lens!

## Hobbies
