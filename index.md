## About Me

I am a senior at lehigh graduating in May 2025. I'm studying Statistics and Finance. After graduation, I will be working at Deuthsche Bank in the Industrials group in NYC. I'm very interested in commodities, energy transition, and the emergence of new technologies (AI).

## Career Objectives

I want to get exposure to different deal processes through my investment banking role at Deutsche Bank. Afterwards, I aim to pivot to an investing role where I can leverage my knowledge in company analysis to identify undervalued opportunities in the Industrials and Commodities spaces. Investing required discipline in terms of understanding what a business is truly worth and not what it's being marketed as. I'm excited to build this investor lens!

## Hobbies

Maybe include a little about these, especially if they are the kinds of things that work well in interviews.
