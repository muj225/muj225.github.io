## About Me

Hi! I’m a senior at Lehigh University, graduating in May 2025 with a dual major in Statistics and Finance. Upon graduation, I’ll be joining Deutsche Bank in New York City as part of the Industrials Investment Banking group.

I have a strong interest in commodities, the energy transition, and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Having grown up across East Africa and South Asia, I’m also deeply engaged with topics related to emerging markets, economic development, and international relations.

## Career Objectives

I want to get exposure to different deal processes through my investment banking role at Deutsche Bank. Afterwards, I aim to pivot to an investing role where I can leverage my knowledge in company analysis to identify undervalued opportunities in the Industrials and Commodities spaces. Investing required discipline in terms of understanding what a business is truly worth and not what it's being marketed as. I'm excited to build this investor lens!

## Hobbies
