## About Me

Hi! I’m a senior at Lehigh University, graduating in May 2025 with a dual major in Statistics and Finance. Upon graduation, I’ll be joining Deutsche Bank in New York City as part of the Industrials Investment Banking group.

I have a strong interest in commodities, the energy transition, and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Having grown up across East Africa and South Asia, I’m also deeply engaged with topics related to emerging markets, economic development, and international relations.

_**[Macro Drivers of Dollar Strength - A Cross-Currency Analysis](https://thereddestbulls.streamlit.app/)**_

I analyzed how U.S. macroeconomic factors (like interest rates, inflation, and trade balance) impact the strength of the U.S. dollar against the world’s top currencies.

Below is the 5 year forecast from the dashboard for USD-EUR, Macroeconomic Variables (2.7% Interest Rate & 2.3% Inflation), XGBoost model

_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify risks](midtermreport.md)**_

Using data dictionaries, sentiment ratings, and financial topic word lists, 10-K filings from S&P 500 firms were analyzed and compared with stock returns around their filing dates to identify correlations between document sentiment and market performance.

## Career Objectives

Through my investment banking role at Deutsche Bank, I’m eager to gain exposure to a variety of deal processes and deepen my understanding of corporate finance. Longer term, I aim to transition into an investing role where I can apply my skills in company analysis to identify undervalued opportunities, particularly in the Industrials and Commodities sectors. I believe successful investing requires the discipline to assess a company’s intrinsic value - beyond how it's marketed - and I’m excited to continue developing that investor mindset.

## Scholars of Finance - A Transformative Experience

In May 2022, I co-founded Lehigh University's chapter of Scholars of Finance (SOF), an organization dedicated to fostering character and integrity in the next generation of finance leaders. While capital is one of the most powerful tools for advancing socio-economic prosperity, the finance industry often suffers from reputational challenges -amplified by bad actors and media portrayals like The Wolf of Wall Street. Through SOF, I’ve developed as a leader and found great fulfillment in helping grow our chapter from the ground up to over 100 members. We've hosted events with leading firms such as KKR and Chatham Financial, and participated in national leadership conferences at institutions like Point72, Deutsche Bank, and Princeton.
